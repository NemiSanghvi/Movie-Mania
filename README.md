## Introduction

Movie Mania is a fun and interactive web application that allows movie enthusiasts to express their preferences among the latest movies. Users are presented with two randomly selected movies from a curated list of the latest releases. They can then choose their favorite movie from the two options. The chosen movie receives a +8 rating, while the other one receives a -8 rating.

Additionally, Movie Mania provides a feature for users to create movie battles. Users can select two movies, create a battle, and publish it on the site for other users to vote on. This enables users to see which movie is preferred by the community and why.
